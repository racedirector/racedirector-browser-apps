		## About

		Fuel calculator provides a simple way to keep track of your fuel while racing.

		## Install

		1. Download and unzip [iRacingBrowserApps](/downloads/iRacingBrowserApps.zip)
		3. Run **server.exe**

		## How to use

		1. Run few clean laps, that calculator has average value of your fuel usage
		2. When in a race session **without pit-stop**, adjust your fuel level in garage until **"Need Refuel"** value will be **0**. Add **1-2** liters of fuel to be safe
		3. When in a race session **with pit-stops**, take full tank of fuel, and while racing keep your eyes on **"Need Refuel"** value. Add **1-2** liters of fuel to **"Need Refuel"** value, to be safe

		## Use on Mobile
		1. Your mobile device should be in one network with your iRacing PC, you might need to open **8182** port on your PC in Windows Firewall
		2. Open [settings](#!/settings) page on you mobile device
		3. Set **Server** parameter to **your_iracing_pc_ip:8182**
		4. Reload page

		## Notes
		1. **"Race Fuel"** doesn't include pace lap
		2. Race with required pit-stop (GT3) can be one lap less due to long pit-stop. For example, if before pit-stop **"Laps in Race"** says 29.2, it's highly possible that after pit-stop **"Laps in Race"** will be only 28.9 (it depends on a weather, lap time and pit-stop duration)
		3. In multiclass race in a slower class car always add 1 lap of fuel, because you never know if faster class will overtake you in the end of the race, or they will stuck behind in traffic
		4. You can hide announce buttons on the top by uncheck all announce options on [settings](#!/settings) page
